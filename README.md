# UserEvidence Challenge Solution: Slot Machine
My approach to this challenge goes beyond simply writing code. I have carefully analyzed the problem, made strategic decisions, and implemented effective problem-solving tactics. The goal is not only to meet the challenge requirements but to exceed expectations through innovative thinking and execution.

To gain a complete understanding of the problem and my proposed solution, please refer to the original instructions provided by UserEvidence. Your feedback is highly valuable to me, as I am eager to refine my approach based on your input.

Let's dive into the details and explore the solution together!

# Original Instructions
### Objective

Jackpot! You've landed a summer gig in Las Vegas! Unfortunately, it's 2020, and the casinos are closed due to COVID-19. Your boss wants to move some of the business online and asks you to build a full-stack app â€” a simple slot machine game, with a little twist. Build it to ensure that the house always wins!

### Brief

When a player starts a game/session, they are allocated 10 credits.
Pulling the machine lever (rolling the slots) costs 1 credit.
The game screen has 1 row with 3 blocks.
For players to win the roll, they have to get the same symbol in each block.
There are 4 possible symbols: cherry (10 credits reward), lemon (20 credits reward), orange (30 credits reward), and watermelon (40 credits reward).
The game (session) state has to be kept on the server.
If the player keeps winning, they can play forever, but the house has something to say about that...
There is a CASH OUT button on the screen, but there's a twist there as well.

### Tasks
- Implement the assignment using any language or framework you feel comfortable with
- When a user opens the app, a session is created on the server, and they have 10 starting credits.
